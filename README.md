The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one of the oldest policies of the European Union (EU). Since its very launch in 1962, it has always been the biggest expenditure item in the EU budget, though its share has been progressively falling from 80% in the 1960s to 37% today. A particularity of the CAP is that the majority of funding is directly paid to individuals and private bodies rather than channelled through programmes co-decided by state or local public authorities.

In 2013, a [regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013R1306&from=en#d1382e5646-549-1) was adopted to make mandatory for Member States to publish every year the list of beneficiaries of CAP funds. The data must contain their names, municipality of residence/registration and amounts of payment broken down by so-called measure (type of payment that "rewards" specific actions). Small recipients (under 1,250 EUR per year) are also included in the data but are anonymized.

In this repository, we publish analyses of these data to better understand who are the beneficiaries of CAP funding and what is the distribution of payments, a recurrent issue raised about this policy because it is said to profit first and foremost to the biggest farmers.
